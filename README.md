Multidimensional databases for storing the airports of the world using tree structures.

The separation of airports to subtrees used the coordinates of each airport (x,y,z axis).
This method of separation improves the time needed to search and do other operations.
The program offered 3D visualization of the entries and how the tree divided
them in subtrees. The goal of the project was to compare the performance of these two tree
structures based on time.
